# The Waste Reporting API

This is a Spring Boot API that aims to encourage it's users within the community to pick up more responsible habits. 
Although there are people who make a living by recycling, our belief is that recycling should be a habit that we should all pick up.

## How it works

The points system is used where 10 points are added for proper recycling habits in a week and 3 points are deducted for negative habits.
The aim is in the future, the points will be used to give people rewards for recycling well, while also allowing us to see which areas we need to do more education at.

## How to run it

Run the command 
```shell
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
